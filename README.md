- 👋 Hi, I’m @BeardedTesterUK
- 👀 I’m interested in Testing, Automation using PlayWright, Selenium with JAVA, Typescript, Python. Dabling in Software Development too
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a number of languages in a more robust software development mindset, to help supplement overall knowledge especially in a Test Automation sense.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any and all tips that can help to a self taught automation engineer
